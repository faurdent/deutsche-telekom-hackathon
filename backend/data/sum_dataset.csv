SPI_index,"National statistical systems are facing significant challenges. These challenges arise from increasing demands for high quality and trustworthy data to guide decision making, coupled with the rapidly changing landscape of the data revolution. To help create a mechanism for learning amongst national statistical systems, the World Bank has developed improved Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) to monitor the statistical performance of countries. The SPI focuses on five key dimensions of a country’s statistical performance: (i) data use, (ii) data services, (iii) data products, (iv) data sources, and (v) data infrastructure. This will replace the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) that the World Bank has regularly published since 2004. The SPI focus on five key pillars of a country’s statistical performance: (i) data use, (ii) data services, (iii) data products, (iv) data sources, and (v) data infrastructure. The SPI are composed of more than 50 indicators and contain data for 186 countries. This set of countries covers 99 percent of the world population. The data extend from 2016-2023, with some indicators going back to 2004.",data/SPI_index.csv
